# haiku-generator
What our project does: 
We created a GUI that allows a user to create Haiku (a poem originally from Japan that uses seventeen syllables, in three lines of five, seven, and five. Conventionally, the theme of the poem is on nature).

Features: generate Haiku randomly using hard-coded words as keywords, create Haiku using a keyword from userâ€™s input, add stats
